Workout recovery is a commonly overlooked aspect of working out, but at Nu Era Fitness, we understand the value, benefit, and overall common sense of ensuring proper fitness recovery.</p>
<p>We offer two types of products to assist your workout routine. The EVA foam products are a phenomenal supplement to help massage out the lactic acid you will inevitably incur following a grueling WOD, and they are offered in different sizes and shapes to cater to your specific needs. The exercise tubing is an excellent way to aid with long, deep stretches, and it also provides light resistance to help warm muscles up prior to engaging in rigorous workouts.</p>
