<p><%= image_tag("/assets/products/121/small/NuEra-Fitness-18%27-Steel-Plyo-Box.png", :class => "taxon-description-image", :alt => "18-inch Steel Plyo Box") %><strong>Plyo Boxes</strong>, short for plyometric boxes, are a great tool for doing box jumps. The plyometric box jump requires a fast, powerful movement by rapidly contracting muscles to elevate the body off the floor and onto the box. Plyometric box jumps not only improve power and strength, they also burn a significant amount of calories when done in higher sets.</p>
<p>Do not think that box jumps are just for elite athletes trying to increase speed, vertical jump height, or explosive power. While these outcomes are achieved by using plyo boxes, there are many other benefits to be gained. Box jumps are a full body, function movement that not only engages fast twitch muscle fibers in the legs, but also require the explosive use of the hips as well as utilizing the core. Many CrossFit workouts, including <a href="http://www.nuerafitness.com/pages/Benchmark-Workouts.html">Benchmark Workouts</a> Danny, Kelly, McGhee, and Nutts, require box jumps in rapid succession giving you the additional benefit of increased heart rate for calorie burn as well as muscle exhaustion.</p>
