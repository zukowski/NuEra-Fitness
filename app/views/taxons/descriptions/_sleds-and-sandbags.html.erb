<p><%= image_tag("/assets/products/132/small/NuEra-Fitness-CrossFit-Power-Sled.png", :class => "taxon-description-image", :alt => "Power Sled") %>Sleds offer an entirely new element of firepower to your crossfit arsenal, and Nu Era Fitness offers both the speed and power sled to help you achieve your fitness goals. Sled training specifically addresses hamstring and glute weakness along with many upper body training variations that can help with poor posture. The sled allows for functional training by utilizing multiple movement patterns without large changes to the equipment itself. Another thing to consider, sleds are phenomenal for training with more than one person and can be used as a specific station of training, team challenges, and many unique/effective methods.</p>
<p>Sandbags have been an integral training tool for athletes for hundreds of years because they provide a versatile, cost-effective training option. Sandbags are especially crucial for stabilizer training because they do not retain their shape and change every time you lift them, thus creating a slightly varied lift with every repetition. The non-cooperative nature of sandbags utilizes every muscle. This is especially true with explosive sandbag lifts such as cleans, throws, snatches, and shouldering. The trunk muscles (including those of the low back and abdominal area) have to work harder to stabilize the body against the awkward load while moving very quickly.</p>
