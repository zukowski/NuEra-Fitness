<p><%= image_tag("/assets/products/87/small/Best-value-Concept2-Rower-offered-by-NuEra-Fitness.png", :class => "taxon-description-image", :alt => "Concept 2 Rower") %>Indoor rowing has taken the CrossFit community by storm, and it has proven itself a highly effective exercise that provides crossfitters a total body functional movement that can be utilized before, during, or after workouts. Whether you are on the water or indoors, the overall body coordination involved with rowing is the same...you catch, drive, finish, and recover in essentially the same way. The stroke is continuous, smooth, and rhythmic. The faster you go, the more resistance you feel in the form of the fluid resistance of air against the flywheel.</p>
<p>Nu Era Fitness is proud to offer the Concept 2 Rower, the industryâ€™s leading row machine. The rower offers an evolutionary flywheel design that minimizes noise and maximizes the smooth feel of rowing on the water. It includes an easy spiral damper that controls the feel of each pull, and the ergonomic handle promotes a natural arm and hand position. The Concept 2 Rower is fully adjustable, from the seat to the digital performance monitor, and it also separates into two parts for easy transport and storage. You cannot go wrong with this machine!</p>
