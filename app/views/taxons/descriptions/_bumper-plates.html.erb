Bumper plates are designed to allow for the safe dropping of heavy loads. Nu Era Fitness firmly believes that it is unnecessary for any gym or individual to purchase metal plates for any type of weight lifting. Bumper plates can serve all you power lifting needs such as the bench press, deadlifts, and squats as well as any type of Olympic style lifts such as the snatch, the clean, and the jerk. Metal plates only work with power lifting, they will damage your bar, floor, and themselves if used in Olympic lifts.</p>
<p>Bumper plates from Nu Era Fitness are made of compressed rubber with a steel or brass core that varies in size depending on weight. An additional benefit of bumper plates over standard metal plates is the uniformity in diameter. Having the barbell loaded with bumper plates of equal diameter allows for the distribution of force impact when the weight hits the floor. Be sure to always go to a larger plate when able, the more rubber that hits the ground at impact the better.</p>
